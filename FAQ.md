## Why is it called "suitdrop"?

The name "Suitdrop" is a fusion of "spacesuit" and "lockdrop", describing the unique mechanism of our protocol. Like a spacesuit preparing an astronaut for an alien environment, Suitdrop equips users with exclusive merchandise in a new way. "Lockdrop" represents the locking mechanism, where tokens are burnt to redeem physical merchandise.

## What is Suitdrop-as-a-Service?

Suitdrop-as-a-Service, or SaaS, is a future addition to our roadmap. It will serve as a permissionless service, enabling any appchain, project, artist, or individual to automate merchandise drops without building and maintaining bespoke ones from scratch. In essence, Suitdrop.zone will become a storefront where anyone can spin up their merch stores. For example, if you're Akash, you could have your merch store under suitdrop.zone/akash.
